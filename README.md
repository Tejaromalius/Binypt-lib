```

## Usage

Here's a brief overview of how to use Binypt:

```python
from binypt import Binypt

# Initialize Binypt
binypt = Binypt()

# Set data retrieval parameters
binypt.set_arguments("BTCUSDT", "1h", "01/09/2023-00:00:00", "10/09/2023-23:59:59")

# Fetch cryptocurrency price data
binypt.retrieve_data()

# Export data to a CSV file
binypt.export("crypto_data.csv")

# Add human-readable timestamps
binypt.add_human_readable_time()

# Show progress bar and log messages
binypt.set_verbosity(show_bar=True, show_log=True)

# Access the data as a Pandas DataFrame
price_data = binypt.get_data()

# You can now perform various data analysis or visualization tasks with the price_data DataFrame
```
