from binypt import Binypt

# Initialize Binypt with your desired parameters
trading_pair = "BTCUSDT"
interval = "1h"
starting_date = "01/01/2023-00:00:00"
ending_date = "01/31/2023-23:59:59"
verbosity = ["bar", "logging"]

binypt = Binypt(trading_pair, interval, starting_date, ending_date, verbosity)

# Download and process the data
output_path = "my_file.csv"
output_file_extension = "csv"
binypt.export(output_path, output_file_extension)

# Access the data as a Pandas DataFrame
price_data = binypt.data

# You can now perform various data analysis or visualization tasks with the price_data DataFrame
```
